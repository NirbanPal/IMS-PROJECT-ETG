# IMS-PROJECT-ETG
It is an inventory management system project. I've used python language for this.Here you can add products/items in your inventory.Then the updated inventory helps you to check your stocks,it means you can check how many products you have in your inventory along with the products details.Then you can sell any products.At the time of selling products bills are automatically generated and provided to the customers so that they will get all the information about their purchase.Then inventory is updated that would help you to check the quantities and details of the products after selling.Afterthat all the transactions are recorded in a json file where you can check the details of the selling products.
